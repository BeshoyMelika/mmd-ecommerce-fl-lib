Our GraphQl needs code generation and update schema to work perfectly.

# Step 1 update schema
    --> open the library with Android Studio and Install .graphql plugin
    --> open .graphqlconfig you will find a play icon next to the url of graphql
    --> click the play icon to update the schema you will find new file generated called general.schema.json
    --> rename general.schema.json to general.schema.graphql (delete the old one if exist)

# Step 2
    --> add your query, mutation and handle cases you want.
    --> update build.yaml file according to your added queries and mutations to generate code successfully

# Step 3 class generation
    --> run this command ""flutter pub run build_runner build"" to generate need classes
