Our GraphQl needs code generation and update schema to work perfectly.

# Step 1 update schema
    --> Download schema from playground as "SDL" 
    --> add this file to the library with name "general.schema.graphql" (delete the old one if exist)

# Step 2
    --> add your query, mutation and handle cases you want.
    --> update build.yaml file according to your added queries and mutations to generate code successfully

""""be careful about the code generation if you have the same model return from different api you will fail""""

# Step 3 class generation
    --> run this command ""flutter pub run build_runner build"" to generate need classes
